<h1>Your MFA secret has been reset!</h1>

<p>
Your MFA secret has been reset so your existing TOTP codes will not work. Use the QR code below to store a new secret in your TOTP device. Do not leave this page until you have stored the new secret in your TOTP device or you won't be able to log in again.
