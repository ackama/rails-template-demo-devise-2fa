# Playground for MFA on devise

This is a Rails app created with [Ackama rails template]().
[PR #1](https://github.com/ackama/rails-template-demo-devise-2fa/pull/1) in this
repo is us experimenting with what an MFA feature on devise should look like.
This repo exists solely to host that PR.

Eventually the code changes in PR #1 will become part of
[rails-template PR #77](https://github.com/ackama/rails-template/pull/77).

This repo is temporary and will go away once we are happy with the shape of the
MFA feature. **Do not depend on this repo continuing to exist**.
