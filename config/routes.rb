  # Workaround a "bug" in lighthouse CLI
  #
  # Lighthouse CLI (versions 5.4 - 5.6 tested) issues a `GET /asset-manifest.json`
  # request during its run - the URL seems to be hard-coded. This file does not
  # exist so, during tests, your test will fail because rails will die with a 404.
  #
  # Lighthouse run from Chrome Dev-tools does not have the same behaviour.
  #
  # This hack works around this. This behaviour might be fixed by the time you
  # read this. You can check by commenting out this block and running the
  # accessibility and performance tests. You are encouraged to remove this hack
  # as soon as it is no longer needed.
